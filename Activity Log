9/4/2019:   Everything still works as it's supposed to. Adjusts accordingly based on input conditions. 

9/18/2019:  Gave our second presentation. Focus of team needs to be on the completion of the motors and sensors hardware components. I need to find a way to help out where I can without taking away anything from other group members.

9/25/2019:  One week later, small progress has been made. Mutaz made sure that we understand the importance of time management. I am still waiting to be able to implement my part of the project.

10/2/2019:  Frame has been built, others are starting to make more progress. I should be close to being able to implement my subsystem. At this point I just need the motors to be attached to the blinds and I will be able to make real progress finally.
