I have successfully connected the app to AWS server.
Encountering a new problem: the app is sending the wrong info to AWS DynamoDB
Currently rewriting code for the backend of the app
Fixing toggle switch for moving the blinds up and down (there is currently no middle option the user can choose so I am changing it to up and down buttons.
After reprogramming backend--will work on HTTP requests from ESP32

9/14/19
finished fixing app. it now sends correct data to db

09/25/19
reprogrammed back end of app
currently programming ESP32
goal by presentation: have blinds built

09/30/19
deployed new back end of app, which for some strange reason has caused problems with the front end. 
ESP32 completely coded and connected, but cant start testing until front end is fixed

10/09/19
app is fully integrated with ESP32 micro controller. 
next step is to help Keith integrate with Nano.

10/18/19
changed format of the array that is sent to keiths system. it is a lot easier to handle now.
I finally finished building the frame for the blinds. Tomorrow I am painting it and mounting the blinds and am going to start 3d modeling 
for pieces that we need to be 3D printed to mount the motors to the blinds. We will find out this weekend if the motors can actually
lift the blinds. If they cant we will need stronger motors because this is going to be our demo set up. The blinds and frame will
not be changing after I am finished with them.
