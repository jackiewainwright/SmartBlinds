I have successfully connected the app to AWS server.
Encountering a new problem: the app is sending the wrong info to AWS DynamoDB
Currently rewriting code for the backend of the app
Fixing toggle switch for moving the blinds up and down (there is currently no middle option the user can choose so I am changing it to up and down buttons.
After reprogramming backend--will work on HTTP requests from ESP32

reprogrammed back end of app
currently programming ESP32
goal by presentation: have blinds built

deployed new back end of app, which for some strange reason has caused problems with the front end. 
ESP32 completely coded and connected, but cant start testing until front end is fixed
