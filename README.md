# SmartBlinds
A senior design project that has a mobile application that sends user preferences (time, light, temp) to a micro controller system. The micro controller system tells the blinds whether to go up or down based off input from the sensor subsystem. The micro controller controls the motors which raises blinds up/down and opens slats.
