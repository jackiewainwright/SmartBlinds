Rough PCB design finished. However, we've decided to get a protoboard version working. For the final product, a protoboard will work. The only problem is reduced technical merit.

Finished proto board.

This proto board is split into 3 boards: nano board, motor board, and power board. 
* Nano board contains the nano, transceiver, multiple resistors for switches, and two transistors. 
* Motor board contains two motor drivers and three header rows providing an interface with the motors. 
* Power board contains the battery charger chip. It has headers connecting the battery, solar panel, and multiple power and ground connections. 

The nano board isn't soldered; it can easily, reliably, and more temporarily be connected with jumper wires. In the future, it may be soldered to become more reliable.

The motor board is fully soldered and tested, and it works.

The power board has the solar and battery components soldered. However, it doesn't have USB power connections soldered; this part may need minor design revisions first. 

Right now, we have a very solid option in the proto boards. There's no real need to get a PCB, except to increase technical merit and make it closer to a marketable product.
